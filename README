__________A01___________
Implementing various matrix calculations and computations

__________A02___________
Responsible for various implementation and usage of various openCV functions and python functions using python 3.6. 
Some of the implementations and usage discussed are computer vision and image processing problems including capturing 
standard images, live images, modifications and implementations of various OpenCV functions.

__________A03___________
Responsible for implementation of Harris corner detection, localization for an image, and also for two 
images(one be with the different viewpoint) feature detection and matching.

__________A04___________
Responsible for implementation of non-coplanar camera calibration which also includes implementation of camera 
calibration for a noisy image with robust estimation to remove outliers using RANSAC.

__________A05___________
Responsible for implementation of Epipolar lines on the two stereo images by inputting the point interactively 
capable to be performed on both the images.

Content Based Image Retrieval
Project descriptionThis project is about content-based image retrieval(CBIR) by extracting features like
color and texture. 
- Responsible for performing retrieval experiments were performed by developing a database of images and querying the image to retrieve the set of similar images.
- Responsible for implementation of Color Feature which involved conversion to HSV color space and maps pixel intensities into an HSV cylinder using color histograms. 
-Deciding the tradeoff between bins sizes of the histograms.
- Defined a Global feature for each image in the database.
- Defined a local color feature for each image in the database by dividing the image into segments and defining a global feature for each segment closely related to human visual
perception.
-Responsible for implementation of Texture Feature refers to visual patterns of an image.
- Defined Co-occurrence matrix for each image in all directions.
- Parameters taken into account were moment of inertia, Angular Second Moment, Correlation and Homogeneity.
-Results showed that when both features are taken into account showed better results(precision = 2 ) independently both feature (precision = 5)
