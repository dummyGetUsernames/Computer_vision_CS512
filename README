A01- Implementing various matrix calculations and computations

A02 - Responsible for various implementation and usage of various openCV functions and python functions using python 3.6. 
Some of the implementations and usage discussed are computer vision and image processing problems including capturing 
standard images, live images, modifications and implementations of various OpenCV functions.

A03- Responsible for implementation of Harris corner detection, localization for an image, and also for two 
images(one be with the different viewpoint) feature detection and matching.

A04- Responsible for implementation of non-coplanar camera calibration which also includes implementation of camera 
calibration for a noisy image with robust estimation to remove outliers using RANSAC.

A05- Responsible for implementation of Epipolar lines on the two stereo images by inputting the point interactively 
capable to be performed on both the images.
